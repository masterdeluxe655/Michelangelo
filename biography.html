  <h1>Life of the artist</h1>
  <p>A side effect of Michelangelo's fame in his lifetime was that his career was more fully documented than that of any artist of the time or earlier. He was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.</p>

  <p> The 15th century was a time of great change and upheaval in Italy. It was a period marked by political instability, foreign invasions, and the rise of powerful city-states such as Milan, Florence, and Venice. This was also a time of great cultural achievements, with the development of the Renaissance, a flowering of art, literature, and science that would have a profound impact on European culture.</p>

  <p>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was born on 6 March 1475 in Caprese, a small town outside Florence, which was at that time Italy's greatest centre for arts and learning. Michelangelo's father was a government official and his mother was a homemaker. He was the second of five brothers and grew up in the small town of Settignano, near Florence. As a young boy, Michelangelo was sent to Florence to study grammar but it was of no interest for him, he preferred paintings from churches and seeking the company of other painters. During Michelangelo's childhood, a team of painters had been called from Florence to the Vatican to decorate the walls of the Sistine Chapel. Among them was Domenico Ghirlandaio, a master in fresco painting, perspective, figure drawing and portraiture who had the largest workshop in Florence.</p> 

  <p>Although Michelangelo's father was reluctant for his son to pursue art, in 1488, at age 13, Michelangelo was apprenticed to Ghirlandaio where he learned the techniques of fresco painting. Ghirlandaio is best known for his frescoes, which can be seen in several churches and other buildings in Florence. Michelangelo learned a great deal from Ghirlandaio and later cited him as an important influence on his own work. In 1489, a wealthy man and Florence's de facto ruler named Lorenzo de Medici asked Ghirlandaio for two of his best pupils. Without hesitation, he recommended Francesco Granacci and Michelangelo.  Lorenzo had taken notice of Michelangelo's unusual talent and, wishing to encourage him, proposed for Michelangelo to move into the palace and live there as his son to be educated along with the Medici children. Lorenzo even offered Michelangelo's father Lodovico a respectable position in the palace. Michelangelo was thrown into the midst of the Medici circle, where he was involved with poetry, science, philosophy, and art. Hence, from 1490 to 1492, the young artist was given a chance to be enrolled in the Humanist Academy, an institution founded by the Medici. During this period, Michelangelo's art was subject to the influence of many signifacan writers of the day such as, Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola.</p>

  <p>Lorenzo de' Medici's death on April 8, 1492, brought a different path in Michelangelo's circumstances. He left the privilege of the Medici company and returned to his father's house. Michelangelo, after a few months completed his wooden crucifix (1493), gifted it to the prior of the Florentine church of Santo Spirito. They assisted Michelangelo's betterment as an artist by permitting him learn human anatomy on the corpses of the church's hospital.</p>

    <p>Scholars have always questioned whether or not Michelangelo studied anatomy. He did in several ways. He conducted studies of classical antiquities and the many human forms available to him in ancient sculptures. More importantly, when he was sixteen years old and a guest at the convent church of Santo Spirito on the south-side of the Arno River in Florence, he dissected corpses from the convent hospital. Besides making drawings of dissections, Michelangelo also studied and drew from the human model. From a very young and influential age, Michelangelo actively developed his concept of architecture as anatomy. <sub><a id="subscript" href="anatomy.html" target="_blank">Click here to read further...</a></sub></p></p>
