  <h1 style="text-align: center;">A brief insight on Michelangelo's studies on human anatomy</h1>

  <p>He had a vision of architecture that was rooted in the understanding of the human body, and his theory of anatomy was articulated in the study and design of architecture. He viewed anatomy—muscles, nerves, and human proportions—as metaphors for the active elements of architecture. Michelangelo's emphasis on the body in his vision and theory of architecture was unprecedented. He saw it all intertwined as life.</p>

  <p>Scholars have always questioned whether or not Michelangelo studied anatomy. He did in several ways. He conducted studies of classical antiquities and the many human forms available to him in ancient sculptures. More importantly, when he was sixteen years old and a guest at the convent church of Santo Spirito on the south-side of the Arno River in Florence, he dissected corpses from the convent hospital. Besides making drawings of dissections, Michelangelo also studied and drew from the human model. From a very young and influential age, Michelangelo actively developed his concept of architecture as anatomy.</p>

  <p>Michelangelo's thirst for anatomical knowledge led to selective permission from the Catholic Church to study cadavers. Much has been written in attempts to explain and rationalize the beauty of his works and the way in which they reflected his knowledge of anatomy.Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo devoted much time to the study of anatomy.</p>

  <p>In the Lives of Artists, Giorgio Vasari, the famous painter and historian described how important anatomy was to artists: <br><br>

  <b><i>"Again having seen human bodies dissected one knows how the bones lie, and the muscles and sinews, and all order of conditions of anatomy . . ."</i></b> </p>
